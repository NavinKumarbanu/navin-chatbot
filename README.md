# Custom LLM Chatbot using Vertex AI Agent Builder & Dialogflow CX

Custom LLM Chatbot using Vertex AI Agent Builder & Dialogflow CX is a scalable, AI-powered conversational assistant that can answer questions based on your own data (documents, PDFs, etc.). Built using Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Builder and Dialogflow CX, the chatbot integrates Gemini Pro, Google's state-of-the-art LLM, to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.

This project leverages cloud-native services to build, train, deploy, and host the chatbot on a lightweight and responsive frontend. By uploading custom documents and connecting them with powerful LLM capabilities, it enables users to interact with data in natural language—making it ideal for use cases like internal support bots, customer service, document Q&A, or educational tools.

## Use Case1: AI Support Chatbot for Educational Institutions

A university or coaching institute wants to provide 24/7 support to students. They receive thousands of queries daily about admission, fee structure, course content, timetables, and scholarships. Human agents are overloaded and support response time is high.
## Use Case2: AI Knowledge Assistant for Enterprises
A mid-to-large size tech company has extensive internal documentation (e.g., HR policies, onboarding guides, technical SOPs, product manuals). Employees frequently open support tickets or ping internal Slack channels for common queries—wasting hours each week.
